# Personal-Portfolio

## Description

The project was done to provide myself with a simple, professional portfolio to use through bootcamp, and beyond. The project will be added to throughout camp, in order to expand my own skills and hireability. It solves several problems, by providing potential employers and collaborators with one place to view my body of work and show off skills at the same time. 

Along the way, I learned several new skills, mostly concerning flex and the versatility it offers. I'm excited to continue learning more about pseudo-elements, and adding effects/animations to my future work. 

## Installation

Accessing the webpage requires only an internet connection and a internet browser. I recommend Google Chrome, for it's versatility.
